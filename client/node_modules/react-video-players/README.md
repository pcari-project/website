# react-video-players

A library of React video player components that share a similar interface and makes
it easy to work with various video platforms (Vimeo, YouTube, etc.) and players,
consistently in your site or application.

## Install

Via [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/react-video-players):

```sh
npm install --save react-video-players
```

Via [Yarn](https://yarn.fyi/react-video-players):

```sh
yarn add react-video-players
```

## Video Players

The goal of this library is to offer a variety of different player "types", while
maintaining a similar/common interface across each component. Currently, there
are three video player components available: `VimeoPlayer`, `YouTubePlayer` and
`VideoPlayer` (standard `<video>` tag implemenation).

In addition to the three components, this library also include the High Order Component
that the three players use, in the event youâ€™d like to use that to build your own
video player component.

### Common Properties

* `aspectRatio:String` - Used to calculate aspect ratio for the container so that
video is displayed responsively.
* `config:Object` - Optional config settings. See [VimeoPlayer Props](#props) or [YouTubePlayer Props](#props-1)
* `controls:Element` - A React component that contains controls setup to control
the video. See [Player Controls](#player-controls)
* `height:Number || String` - Height of the player. Default `100%`.
* `loop:Boolean` - Whether or not the video should loop playback. Default `false`.
* `play:Boolean` - Whether or not the video should play on load. Default `false`.
* `time:Number` - Time to play when the player loads, or seek time if the player is already loaded. Default `0`.
* `width:Number || String` - Width of the player. Default `100%`.

### Callbacks

* `onEnded:Function` - Callback when video playback has ended.
* `onError:Function` - Callback when an error occurs within the player.
* `onPause:Function` - Callback when video player is paused.
* `onPlay:Function` - Callback when video player is played.
* `onReady:Function` - Callback when video player is ready.
* `onTimeUpdate:Function` - Callback when video player time updates.

### Player Components

#### `VimeoPlayer`

The `VimeoPlayer` component is a simple React wrapper around the standard Vimeo
Player embed. For more informatin on how to work with the Vimeo Player directly,
check out this repo, [@vimeo/player.js](https://github.com/vimeo/player.js), for
more info and examples.

The `VimeoPlayer` component offers limited control of the player via the `props`
on the component: `loop`, `play`, `time` and `volume`. Iâ€™m open to adding more
access to some of the other methods available on the player via props, but to
keep it simple Iâ€™ve started with these four.

##### Props

* `config:Object` - Options that are passed to the player on setup,
Available [embedOptions](https://github.com/vimeo/player.js#embed-options).
* `videoId:Number` - ID of the Vimeo video you'd like to load in the player.

##### Example

```js
import {VimeoPlayer} from 'react-video-players';

...

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <VimeoPlayer videoId="225408543" />
      </div>
    );
  }

...

```

#### `YouTubePlayer`

Similar to the `VimeoPlayer` component, the `YouTubePlayer` component is a simple
React wrapper around the YouTube Player, allowing for basic control and configuration,
allowing you to use it how you want within your React sites/applications.

##### Props

* `config:Object` - The `config` object is mapped to the `playerVars` property
used when creating the player. Available [playerVars](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters?playerVersion=HTML5#Parameters).
* `playlist:String` - An optional value that can be set when you would like to
load a playlist into the player. This property is also set to the `videoId` when
the `loop` flag has been set on the player (which is required for the YouTube Player
to loop the video).
* `videoId:String` - String to the YouTube video ID you would like to load in the player.

##### Example

```js
import {YouTubePlayer} from 'react-video-players';

...

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <YouTubePlayer videoId="8gXpZmQ7j70" />
      </div>
    );
  }

...

```

#### `VideoPlayer`

Just your plain oleâ€™Â `<video>` tag, wrapped in a similar interface to the other
platform specific players. You could use this as is if you have direct access
to video urls, or use it as a base for a more complex video player that youâ€™re
building in React.

##### Props

* `config:Object` - An object containing the additional attributes that are available
for the `<video>` tag, but are not exposed via other props. (Ex. `controls`, `poster`, `preload`, etc.)
* `src:String` - URL to video content.

##### Example

```js
import {VideoPlayer} from 'react-video-players';

...

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <VideoPlayer src="[...your video source url...]" />
      </div>
    );
  }

...

```

### `playerController` (Higher Order Component)

Want to build your own embeddable player using a different providers player? No problem ðŸ˜Ž

Included in this library is the a High Order Component that wraps all the players
in this library, `playerController`. The `playerController` is responsible for
wiring up the `controls`, along with handling some basic style and callback handling
within video component instances so that weâ€™re not repeating ourselves too much.

Feel free to use the `playerController` to write your own React video players that
wrap embeddable players from other video providers. Also, if you end up writing
a really awesome component for another provider, and youâ€™d like to add it to this
repo, just make a PR with your additions and Iâ€™ll checkâ€™em out and merge them in
as soon as I can.

#### Example

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {playerController} from 'react-video-players';

class YourRadVideoPlayer extends Component {

...

}
...

export default playerController(YourRadVideoPlayer);

```

## Player Controls

The `controls` property on the video player components makes it easy to compose
controls in context with the video player and provide a simple way to keep controls
in sync with the video state, while also providing callbacks that can be used
to control video playback.

### Properties

* `loop:Boolean` - Loop status of video
* `play:Boolean` - Playing status of video
* `time:Number` - Current time of video
* `volume:Number` - Current volume of video

### Callback

* `onPause:Function` - Callback to pause video
* `onPlay:Function` - Callback to play video
* `onSeek:Function` - Callback to seek video
* `onVolumeChange:Function` - Callback to change the volume of video
